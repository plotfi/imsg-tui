# Instalation
 
Easiest way to get things off the ground is intall on a Mac via homebrew (see https://github.com/steipete/homebrew-tap):

```
brew install steipete/tap/imsg
```

then

```
https://github.com/plotfi/imsg-tui
cd imsg-tui
python3 imsg-tui.py
```

You will need imsg to be in your path, or provide the path with `--imsg-path`
